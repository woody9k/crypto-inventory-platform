The security of the Crypto Inventory Platform is a top priority. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing: **security@democorp.com**

Include the following information in your report:

1. **Type of issue** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
2. **Full paths** of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
3. **Location** of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
4. **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
5. **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
6. **Impact** of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Triage**: Within 72 hours
- **Status Updates**: Weekly updates on progress
- **Resolution**: Target within 90 days for critical issues

### What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report
2. **Investigation**: We'll investigate and validate the reported vulnerability
3. **Fix Development**: We'll develop and test a fix for the vulnerability
4. **Coordinated Disclosure**: We'll work with you on timing of public disclosure
5. **Credit**: We'll provide appropriate credit for your discovery (if desired)
