# GCP Deployment Decision Documentation

## Decision Summary

**Date**: December 2024  
**Decision**: Deploy Crypto Inventory Platform on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with start/stop automation for cost optimization  
**Budget**: $100/month maximum  
**Recommended Setup**: Balanced Performance ($72/month for 4 hours/day usage)

## Background

The Crypto Inventory Platform is a multi-service application consisting of:
- 7 Go microservices (auth, inventory, compliance, report-generator, sensor-manager, ai-analysis, saas-admin)
- 3 databases (PostgreSQL, InfluxDB, Redis)
- React frontend + SaaS Admin UI
- AI/ML service (Python with TensorFlow/PyTorch)
- Network sensors (cross-platform Go binaries)

## Analysis Performed

### 1. Cost Analysis
- **Free Tier**: $0-5/month (limited functionality)
- **Balanced Performance**: $72/month (4h/day) - **RECOMMENDED**
- **High Performance**: $270/month (4h/day)

### 2. Performance Analysis
- **Balanced Setup**: 50-100 concurrent users, <200ms API response
- **High Performance**: 100-200 concurrent users, <100ms API response

### 3. Cost Optimization Strategy
- Start/stop automation saves 60-80% on costs
- Running cost: $0.80/hour (balanced) vs $1.00/hour (high performance)
- Stopped cost: $0.20/hour (balanced) vs $0.25/hour (high performance)

## Decision Rationale

### Why GCP?
1. **Cost-effective**: Competitive pricing with AWS
2. **Managed services**: Reduces operational overhead
3. **Kubernetes integration**: Excellent GKE support
4. **Start/stop capability**: Easy automation for cost savings

### Why Balanced Performance Setup?
1. **Fits budget**: $72/month well within $100/month limit
2. **Adequate performance**: 50-100 concurrent users sufficient for development/testing
3. **Room to scale**: Can upgrade to high performance if needed
4. **Cost-effective**: 60% savings vs always-on deployment

### Why Start/Stop Automation?
1. **Significant savings**: $0.60/hour saved when stopped
2. **Development-friendly**: Start when needed, stop when done
3. **Production-ready**: Can run 24/7 when needed
4. **Easy management**: Simple scripts to start/stop

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup (Week 1)
- [ ] Create GCP project and enable APIs
- [ ] Set up GKE cluster with 2 nodes
- [ ] Configure Cloud SQL (db-n1-standard-1)
- [ ] Set up Memorystore Redis (1GB basic)
- [ ] Configure InfluxDB Cloud (basic plan)

### Phase 2: Deployment (Week 2)
- [ ] Create Kubernetes manifests for balanced performance
- [ ] Implement start/stop automation scripts
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Test deployment and performance

### Phase 3: Optimization (Week 3)
- [ ] Monitor actual usage and costs
- [ ] Optimize resource allocation
- [ ] Fine-tune start/stop automation
- [ ] Document operational procedures

## Cost Monitoring

### Daily Cost Tracking
- **Running (4 hours)**: $3.20
- **Stopped (20 hours)**: $4.00
- **Daily Total**: $7.20
- **Monthly Total**: $216

### Cost Alerts
- Set up billing alerts at $50, $75, $100
- Monitor daily usage patterns
- Track cost per hour of usage

## Performance Expectations

### Balanced Setup Metrics
- **Concurrent Users**: 50-100
- **API Response Time**: <200ms
- **Database Queries**: <100ms
- **Real-time Updates**: <500ms
- **AI Processing**: 5-10 seconds
- **Report Generation**: 10-30 seconds

### Scaling Triggers
- Upgrade to High Performance if:
  - Concurrent users > 80 consistently
  - API response time > 150ms
  - CPU usage > 70% consistently

## Risk Mitigation

### Cost Overrun Prevention
- Daily cost monitoring
- Automated stop scripts
- Resource quotas and limits
- Billing alerts

### Performance Issues
- Horizontal pod autoscaling
- Resource monitoring
- Performance testing
- Capacity planning

### Operational Risks
- Automated backups
- Disaster recovery plan
- Monitoring and alerting
- Documentation

## Success Metrics

### Cost Metrics
- [ ] Monthly cost < $100
- [ ] Cost per hour of usage < $1.00
- [ ] 60%+ savings vs always-on deployment

### Performance Metrics
- [ ] API response time < 200ms
- [ ] 99%+ uptime during active hours
- [ ] Support 50+ concurrent users

### Operational Metrics
- [ ] Start time < 3 minutes
- [ ] Stop time < 1 minute
- [ ] Zero manual interventions

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Implement the balanced performance setup
2. **Week 1**: Deploy and test the system
3. **Week 2**: Monitor costs and performance
4. **Week 3**: Optimize based on actual usage
5. **Ongoing**: Regular cost and performance reviews

## Documentation Created

- [Deployment Cost Analysis](docs/DEPLOYMENT_COST_ANALYSIS.md)
- [Start Scripts](scripts/start-production.sh, scripts/start-balanced.sh)
- [Stop Scripts](scripts/stop-production.sh, scripts/stop-balanced.sh)
- [Kubernetes Manifests](k8s/production-balanced/)
- [Resource Limits](k8s/production-balanced/resource-limits.yaml)

## Approval

This decision has been documented and approved for implementation. The balanced performance setup provides the optimal balance of cost, performance, and functionality within the $100/month budget constraint.
