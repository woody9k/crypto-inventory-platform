## üéØ Usage Guide

### Generating Reports

1. **Via Web UI**:
   - Navigate to `/reports` in the web interface
   - Click "Generate Report" button
   - Select report template from the modal
   - Configure parameters as needed
   - Monitor generation status in real-time

2. **Via API**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8083/api/v1/reports/generate \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "type": "crypto_summary",
       "title": "Custom Report",
       "format": "pdf"
     }'
   ```

### Report Status Tracking

Reports progress through the following states:
- **Generating**: Report is being created
- **Completed**: Report is ready for download
- **Failed**: Report generation encountered an error

### Downloading Reports

Completed reports can be downloaded via:
- Web UI download button
- Direct API access to download URL
- Programmatic access using report ID

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Report Generator Service
PORT=8083                    # Service port

     return map[string]interface{}{
       "metric1": value1,
       "metric2": value2,
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Add Template**:
   ```go
   {
     ID:          "new_report_type",
     Name:        "New Report Type",
     Description: "Description of the new report",
     Type:        "custom",
     Category:    "security",
   }
   ```

3. **Update UI**:
   - Add icon mapping in `getTypeIcon()`
   - Update template list
   - Add any specific UI components

### Testing

```bash
# Test report generator
cd services/report-generator
go test ./...

# Test API endpoints
curl http://localhost:8083/health
curl http://localhost:8083/api/v1/reports/templates
```

## üìû Support

For questions or issues with the reporting system:

1. Check the API health endpoint: `GET /health`
2. Review service logs: `docker-compose logs report-generator`
3. Verify database connectivity
4. Check network connectivity between services
