# NETWORK SENSOR Development - Session Handoff Notes

## Session Summary

**Date**: 2024-12-15  
**Development Track**: Network Sensor Agent Architecture and Design  
**Status**: Design phase complete, ready for implementation planning  
**Note**: This is specifically for NETWORK SENSOR development. Primary Interface development will have separate handoff notes.

## What We Accomplished

### ✅ Completed Design Areas

1. **Core Sensor Requirements** - Defined passive/active discovery, resource constraints, deployment scenarios
2. **Architecture Design** - Cross-platform Go agent with dual-core optimization, <100MB memory/storage
3. **Security & Authentication** - Registration key system, mutual TLS, encrypted ephemeral storage
4. **Installation Process** - Admin-required installation with environment auto-detection
5. **Error Handling** - Graceful degradation strategies for component failures
6. **Complete Documentation** - Created `architecture_docs/13_network_sensor_technical_specification.md`

### 📋 Key Design Decisions Made

**Discovery Methods**:
- Primary: Passive packet analysis (TLS handshakes, certificate capture)
- Fallback: Active probing for TLS 1.3 when passive fails
- Accuracy over volume: Analyze partial handshakes rather than wait for complete data

**Resource Constraints**:
- Memory: <100MB total (8MB packet buffer, 10MB connection tracker, etc.)
- Storage: <100MB total (50MB rotating logs, 30MB cert cache, etc.)
- CPU: Dual core optimization (Core 1: capture, Core 2: analysis)

**Deployment Profiles**:
- End user machine (minimal footprint)
- Datacenter host (full monitoring)
- Cloud instance (periodic connectivity)
- Air-gapped (encrypted file exports)

**Authentication**:
- Registration keys from UI (format: REG-{tenant}-{date}-{checksum})
- Mutual TLS with sensor-specific certificates
- Boot-time encryption key generation for ephemeral storage

**Cross-Platform Strategy**:
- Pure Go with raw sockets (no CGO dependencies)
- Admin privileges required for installation
- Single binary deployment across Windows/Linux/macOS

## Next Session Priorities

### 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

1. **Go Package Architecture Design** (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
   - Define package structure and module organization
   - Design interfaces between components (capture, analysis, export)
   - Plan dependency management and third-party libraries

2. **Implementation Planning**
   - Identify Go libraries for packet capture (gopacket vs raw sockets)
   - Design crypto analysis pipeline
   - Plan cross-platform build system

3. **Prototype Development** (if ready to code)
   - Start with basic packet capture framework
   - Implement TLS handshake parsing
   - Build registration system

### 🔍 Open Questions for Next Session

1. **Library Selection**:
   - Final decision on packet capture approach (raw sockets vs gopacket)
   - TLS parsing libraries (crypto/tls, custom parser, or third-party)
   - Certificate analysis libraries

2. **Build System**:
   - Cross-compilation strategy for Windows/Linux/macOS/ARM
   - Dependency management approach
   - Automated testing across platforms

3. **Development Environment**:
   - Local development setup for sensor testing
   - Integration testing with mock control plane
   - Testing framework for cross-platform validation

## Documentation Status

### ✅ Complete Documentation
- `architecture_docs/13_network_sensor_technical_specification.md` - Comprehensive sensor design
- Updated `architecture_docs/README.md` with new documentation index
- All design decisions documented for other AI agents

### 📁 Related Files to Review
- `sensor/cmd/main.go` - Current stub implementation
- `sensor/go.mod` - Module configuration
- `architecture_docs/02_system_architecture.md` - Overall system context
- `architecture_docs/04_data_models.md` - Data structures and schemas

## Integration Context

### 🤝 Coordination with Primary Interface Team
- Primary interface team has full sensor documentation
- Sensor export format designed for primary interface ingestion
- PCAP ingestion capability planned for primary interface (separate from sensor)
- API specifications defined for sensor management and data collection

### 🔗 Dependencies
- Control plane authentication system (for sensor registration)
- Sensor Manager service (for fleet coordination)
- Database schemas (for discovery data storage)
- Primary UI (for registration key generation)

## Technical Environment

### 🛠️ Current State
- Go 1.24.6 environment configured
- Basic sensor stub with command-line interface
- Project structure established with services architecture
- Docker compose environment for development

### 📦 Dependencies to Consider
```go
// Potential Go packages for evaluation:
- github.com/google/gopacket (packet capture)
- golang.org/x/net (network utilities)
- golang.org/x/crypto (cryptographic functions)
- github.com/gorilla/websocket (real-time communication)
- github.com/sirupsen/logrus (structured logging)
```

## Session Transition

**How to Resume**:
1. Review `architecture_docs/13_network_sensor_technical_specification.md` for complete context
2. Check TODO list (one pending item: Go package architecture design)
3. Start with Go package structure and interface design
4. Consider creating a simple packet capture prototype

**Key Files to Start With**:
- `sensor/cmd/main.go` - Expand stub implementation
- Create `sensor/internal/` package structure
- Design `sensor/pkg/` for reusable components

This handoff provides complete context for continuing **NETWORK SENSOR** development in the next session!

**IMPORTANT**: This file is specifically for Network Sensor development track. The Primary Interface development will have its own separate session handoff notes file.
