```

### 2. **Create GitHub Repository**

**Option A: Using GitHub CLI**
```bash
# Install and authenticate GitHub CLI
sudo snap install gh
gh auth login

# Create repository
gh repo create crypto-inventory-platform --public --description "Enterprise SaaS platform for cryptographic discovery, inventory, and compliance management"

# Set remote and push
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/crypto-inventory-platform.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Option B: Using GitHub Web Interface**
1. Go to https://github.com and create new repository
2. Name: `crypto-inventory-platform`
3. Description: `Enterprise SaaS platform for cryptographic discovery, inventory, and compliance management`
4. Don't initialize with README (we have one)
5. Copy the repository URL and run:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/crypto-inventory-platform.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. **Set Up Issues and Project Management**
```bash
# Create initial development issues
./scripts/create-github-issues.sh

# This creates:
