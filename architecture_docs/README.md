## Quick Start

For developers joining the project:

1. **Understand the Business** → Read `01_business_overview.md`
2. **Learn the Architecture** → Review `02_system_architecture.md`
3. **Set Up Development** → Follow `06_deployment_guide.md` local setup
4. **Explore APIs** → Reference `05_api_specifications.md`
5. **Database Schema** → Study `04_data_models.md`

For AI agents continuing development:

1. **Start Here** → `07_ai_agent_handoff_guide.md` contains everything needed
2. **Reference Architecture** → Use other documents for detailed context
3. **Implementation Priority** → Follow the phased approach outlined in the handoff guide

## Key Principles

### Handoff-Ready Development
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Every decision explained
- **Standard Patterns**: Consistent code structure across services
- **Clear Interfaces**: Well-defined APIs and service boundaries
- **Automated Testing**: Full test coverage for reliability

### Security First
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Never trust, always verify
- **Encryption Everywhere**: TLS 1.3, encryption at rest
- **Multi-tenant Isolation**: Secure tenant separation
- **Compliance Ready**: SOC 2, GDPR, NIST framework support

### Enterprise Focus
- **Multi-tenancy**: Isolated tenant environments
- **SSO Integration**: SAML/OIDC support
- **Role-based Access**: Granular permissions
- **Scalability**: Cloud-native horizontal scaling

### Cloud-Native Design
- **Microservices**: Loosely coupled service architecture
- **Container-First**: Docker for consistent deployments
- **Kubernetes Ready**: Production orchestration
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform for reproducible environments
