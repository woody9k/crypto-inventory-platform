## Key Principles

### Handoff-Ready Development
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Every decision explained
- **Standard Patterns**: Consistent code structure across services
- **Clear Interfaces**: Well-defined APIs and service boundaries
- **Automated Testing**: Full test coverage for reliability

### Security First
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Never trust, always verify
- **Encryption Everywhere**: TLS 1.3, encryption at rest
- **Multi-tenant Isolation**: Secure tenant separation
- **Compliance Ready**: SOC 2, GDPR, NIST framework support

### Enterprise Focus
- **Multi-tenancy**: Isolated tenant environments
- **SSO Integration**: SAML/OIDC support
- **Role-based Access**: Granular permissions
- **Scalability**: Cloud-native horizontal scaling

### Cloud-Native Design
- **Microservices**: Loosely coupled service architecture
- **Container-First**: Docker for consistent deployments
- **Kubernetes Ready**: Production orchestration
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform for reproducible environments
