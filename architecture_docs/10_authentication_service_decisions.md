- ✅ **Enterprise Ready**: Build foundation for enterprise sales

---

## ❓ **Pending Decisions**

### **SSO Implementation Strategy**
**Options:**
- **A**: SSO Foundation Only (architecture + password auth, providers in Phase 2)
- **B**: Core SSO Providers Now (Azure AD + Google immediately)

**Status**: ✅ **DECIDED - Middle Ground Approach**
- **Password Authentication**: Full implementation with complexity rules
- **MS365 (Azure AD)**: OAuth/OIDC implementation 
- **Google OAuth**: Full implementation
- **Provider Framework**: Extensible architecture for future providers (SAML, Okta, etc.)
- **Future Expansion**: Built-in capability to add more providers

### **Tenant Self-Registration Flow**

#### **Scenario-Based Decision Framework**

**Scenario 1: ACME Corp wants to try your platform**
- Security team member `john@acmecorp.com` visits your site
- Clicks "Start Free Trial" 
- **Question A**: What happens next?

**Option A1 - Instant Access**
```
1. John fills form: name, email, company, password
2. System creates tenant "acmecorp" immediately  
3. John gets admin access to empty tenant
4. Can invite team members right away
```
*Pros: Frictionless onboarding, quick evaluation*
*Cons: Potential abuse, no domain ownership verification*

**Option A2 - Email Verification**
```
1. John fills form: name, email, company, password
2. System sends verification email to john@acmecorp.com
3. John clicks link, tenant "acmecorp" gets created
4. John gets admin access
```
*Pros: Prevents fake emails, basic verification*
*Cons: Extra step, delayed gratification*

**Option A3 - Domain Verification**
```
1. John fills form: name, email, company, password
2. System requires domain ownership proof (DNS TXT record)
3. Admin reviews and approves tenant creation
4. John gets access after approval
```
*Pros: Prevents impersonation, verified ownership*
*Cons: Technical barrier, slower onboarding*

#### **Questions:**
1. **Verification Level**: ✅ **DECIDED - Email Verification (A2)**
2. **Tenant Naming**: Auto-generate from company name, or let user choose?
3. **Trial Limitations**: ⏳ **NEEDS DEEPER ANALYSIS**
4. **Upgrade Path**: ⏳ **NEEDS DEEPER ANALYSIS**

**Status**: ✅ **PARTIALLY DECIDED** - Email verification confirmed, freemium model needs detailed planning

### **SSO Configuration Management**
**Questions:**
1. Per-tenant SSO provider configuration?
2. Tenant self-service SSO setup vs admin assistance?
3. Multiple SSO providers per tenant support?

**Status**: ⏳ **AWAITING USER DECISION**

### **User Identity Management**

#### **Complex Identity Scenarios**

**Scenario 1: The Existing User Problem**
```
Timeline:
Day 1: John registers with password: john@acmecorp.com
Day 30: ACME Corp adds Microsoft 365 SSO
Day 31: John tries to login via MS365 SSO with same email
```
**Questions:**
- Should system auto-link the accounts?
- Require John to confirm the link?
- Create a second user account?

**Scenario 2: The Multiple Identity Problem**
```
John has THREE ways to authenticate:
1. Password account: john@acmecorp.com (work email)
2. Google OAuth: john.doe@gmail.com (personal)  
3. MS365 SSO: john@acmecorp.com (work SSO)
```
**Questions:**
- Are these the same person or different users?
- How do we handle conflicting data?
- Which identity takes precedence?

**Scenario 3: The Domain Migration Problem**
```
ACME Corp gets acquired by BigCorp
Users need to migrate from:
- john@acmecorp.com → john@bigcorp.com
- But keep all their data and permissions
```

#### **Identity Linking Strategy Options**

**Option B1 - Email-Based Auto-Linking**
```
✅ Same email = same user (automatic merge)
❌ Risk: Email spoofing, accidental merges
🔧 Implementation: Simple, fast
```

**Option B2 - Confirmation-Based Linking**
```
✅ System detects email match, asks user to confirm
✅ User control over account merging
❌ Extra friction, potential confusion
🔧 Implementation: Moderate complexity
```

**Option B3 - Separate Identities**
```
✅ Each auth method = separate user
✅ No accidental data mixing
❌ User confusion, data fragmentation
🔧 Implementation: Simple but UX issues
```

**Option B4 - Smart Identity Resolution**
```
✅ AI/rules engine to determine if same person
✅ Handles edge cases intelligently
❌ Complex logic, potential errors
🔧 Implementation: Very complex
```

#### **Questions for Decision:**
1. **Primary Strategy**: ✅ **DECIDED - Confirmation-Based Linking (B2)**
2. **User Control**: Should users manage their identity links?
3. **Data Ownership**: When accounts merge, whose data wins?
4. **Audit Trail**: Track all identity linking for security?
5. **Enterprise Migration**: Support for domain changes/acquisitions?

**Status**: ✅ **PARTIALLY DECIDED** - Strategy confirmed, implementation details need refinement

### **Administrative Scope**
**Questions:**
1. Platform admins manage all tenants?
2. Tenant admins only manage their users?
3. Hybrid administrative model?

**Status**: ⏳ **AWAITING USER DECISION**

### **Technical Architecture**
**Questions:**
1. Custom domain support for SSO endpoints?
2. Redis sessions for SSO state vs pure stateless JWT?
3. Same JWT for web UI and API, or separate service tokens?
4. Password complexity rules configurable per tenant?

**Status**: ⏳ **AWAITING USER DECISION**

### **Database Implications for Freemium**

#### **Required Data Model Additions**
```sql
-- Subscription tiers and limits
CREATE TABLE subscription_tiers (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'free', 'professional', 'enterprise'
    max_sensors INTEGER,
    max_assets INTEGER,
    retention_days INTEGER,
    features JSONB, -- enabled feature flags
    price_cents INTEGER,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Tenant subscription tracking
ALTER TABLE tenants ADD COLUMN subscription_tier_id UUID REFERENCES subscription_tiers(id);
ALTER TABLE tenants ADD COLUMN trial_ends_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;
ALTER TABLE tenants ADD COLUMN billing_email VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE tenants ADD COLUMN payment_status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'trial';

-- Usage tracking for limits
CREATE TABLE tenant_usage (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    tenant_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES tenants(id),
    sensors_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    assets_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    users_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    storage_bytes BIGINT DEFAULT 0,
    api_calls_month INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    last_calculated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### **Technical Implementation Considerations**

#### **Limit Enforcement Points**
1. **Sensor Registration**: Block new sensors if limit exceeded
2. **Asset Discovery**: Stop processing if asset limit reached  
3. **Data Retention**: Auto-delete old data based on tier
4. **Feature Gates**: Check permissions for AI, integrations, etc.
5. **API Rate Limiting**: Different limits per tier

#### **Billing Integration Prep**
- **Stripe Integration**: Subscription management
- **Usage Metering**: Track billable events
